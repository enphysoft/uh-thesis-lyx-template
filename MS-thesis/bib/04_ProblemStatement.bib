	abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study of wave attenuation, setup, and runup by using the CSHORE model with newly-developed capabilities for simulating interaction of waves, currents, and vegetation in vegetated beaches. A set of experimental cases done by Løvås and Tørum (2001) were simulated to validate both wave and flow models in CSHORE. Through quantifying statistical errors in simulated waves, assessment of model skills shows that the vegetation model in CSHORE reproduced the wave breaking in the cases without vegetation and both wave attenuation and breaking with the presence of vegetation on the beach. Simulated wave setup and runup show reasonable responses of the vegetation model to vegetation resistance.},
