One explanation for this difference is the radically contrasting sky orientations that are viewed from different parts of the globe, a determinative environmental factor in the development of cosmological systems that should not be neglected by the anthropologist and cultural historian.},

  Abstract                 = {The simulation of Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) flows is commonly performed using commercial CFD codes with RANS turbulence modeling, applying the standard k-Îµ model. However, when applied to the simulation of the homogenous ABL, this approach may result in an undesired decay of the velocity and turbulent fullyâdeveloped profiles specified at the inlet of the computational domain. This behavior is due to an inconsistency between turbulence model, inflow conditions and wall function formulation. An approach has been introduced recently to overcome this problem, which consists in the modification of the turbulence model and wall function formulation to retrieve an overall consistent treatment of the neutral ABL. Such methodology, previously applied to simulation of the atmospheric boundary layer over flat terrain and ground-mounted bluff bodies, is here applied to the simulation of the flow over complex terrains and hills, at wind tunnel and atmosphere scale. In a time of limited scientific funding, the availability of open source CFD software such as OpenFOAM is a very attractive option to investigate; therefore, a comparison between OpenFOAM and the commercial code FLUENT 13.0 has been carried out in the present paper. The potential of the proposed methodology and the satisfactory performances of OpenFOAM are demonstrated.},

  Abstract                 = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

  Abstract                 = {This study places the recently excavated ninth-century A.D. four-part calendrical notations at Xultun (Lunar Table, Ring Number, Long Count, and Multiplication Table) in the context of both Classic monumental inscriptions and astronomical knowledge in the Postclassic Dresden Codex. We demonstrate that the Lunar Table employed a formula attributed to Palenque and that it could have been used as a device to determine precisely where to break the sequence of alternating 29-and 30-day months one finds on dated monuments. All four categories found at Xultun appear in the Dresden Codex. The Ring Number, which bridges a date in the deep past with one in the recently completed era, is a perfect fit with one of the most fundamental Dresden eclipse cycles. Our analysis of glyphs accompanying the Long Count date enables us to place candidate eclipses, especially one that corresponds with a conjunction of Mars, in real time. We argue that the large multiples were extracted from, or prepared for, warning tables like the Dresden eclipse table, and we demonstrate why such tables must have existed well before the Xultun inscriptions. Thus, while the writings in the Dresden manuscript constitute a finished product, the writing on the wall of residential Structure 10K-2 is more akin to what one might find in an astronomer's notebook. Sobre las murallas de la recién excavada estructura residencial denominada 10K-2 en Xultún, Guatemala (fechada para el siglo nueve d.C.), aparecen cuatro notaciones calendáricas (una tabla lunar, un Número de Anillo, una fecha de la Cuenta Larga, y una tabla de múltiplos). Este estudio sitúa estas notaciones en el contexto de las inscripciones clásicas monumentales y el conocimiento astronómico del Códice de Dresde del período posclásico. Mostramos que la tabla lunar emplea una fórmula posiblemente desarrollada en Palenque con la intención de determinar precisamente en dónde interrumpir la alternación de los meses de 29 y 30 días que se encuentren en monumentos fechados del período clásico. Las cuatro categorías encontradas en Xultún se manifiestan en el Códice de Dresde. El Número de Anillo, que conecta una fecha en el pasado remoto con una en la era actual, se ajusta precisamente con uno de los más fundamentales ciclos de eclipses. Nuestro análisis de los glifos ubicados al la derecha de la fecha de la Cuenta Larga facilita la colocación de eclipses posibles en el tiempo histórico, especialmente un eclipse que fue en conjunción con el planeta Marte. Mostramos que los múltiplos grandes fueron extraídos de o preparados para tablas de advertencia en la misma forma que la tabla de eclipses en el Códice de Dresde, y que tales tablas existían mucho antes que las inscripciones sobre las murallas de la estructura en Xultún. Por lo tanto, aunque las escrituras en el manuscrito de Dresde representan un producto final, la escritura sobre las murallas de la estructura 10K-2 se parece más a la que se encontraría en el cuaderno perteneciente a un astrónomo.},

Abstract

Front solutions of the one-dimensional Richards’ equation used to

describe groundwater flow are studied systematically for the three soil

retention models known as Brooks-Corey, Mualem-Van Genuchten and

Storm-Fujita. Both the infiltration problem when water percolates from

the surface into the ground under the influence of gravity and the imbi-

bition (absorption) problem when groundwater diffuses in the horizontal

direction without the gravity effect are considered. In general, self-similar

solutions of the first kind in the form of the front exist only for the imbi-

bition case; such solutions are stable against small perturbations. In the

particular case of the Brooks-Corey model, self-similar solutions of the

  Abstract                 = {In this paper the theory of the stability of viscous flow between two rotating coaxial cylinders which has been developed by Taylor, Jeffreys and Meksyn is extended to the case when the fluid considered is an electrical conductor and a magnetic field along the axis of the cylinders is present. A differential equation of order eight is derived which governs the situation in marginal stability; and a significant set of boundary conditions for the problem is formulated. The case when the two cylinders are rotating in the same direction and the difference (d) in their radii is small compared to their mean (R0) is investigated in detail. A variational procedure for solving the underlying characteristic value problem and determining the critical Taylor numbers for the onset of instability is described. As in the case of thermal instability of a horizontal layer of fluid heated below, the effect of the magnetic field is to inhibit the onset of instability, the inhibiting effect being the greater, the greater the strength of the field and the value of the electrical conductivity. In both cases, the inhibiting effect of the magnetic field depends on the strength of the field (H), the density ($\rho$ ) and the coefficients of electrical conductivity ($\sigma$ ), kinematic viscosity ($\nu$ ) and magnetic permeability ($\mu$ ) through the same non-dimensional combination Q = $\mu$ 2H2d2$\sigma$ /$\rho$ $\nu$ ; however, the effect on rotational stability is more pronounced than on thermal instability. A table of the critical Taylor numbers for various values of Q is provided.},

Recent approaches to the problem include our Markov models for extreme wind simulation applicable to a well-behaved climate as well as typhoon-prone regions.

Recently, we realized that the application of these simulation models, for inexperienced users, is tedious, painstaking and time-consuming. Therefore, our current effort is to utilize an expert system shell to facilitate the application of the simulation models in a microcomputer environment. An application of this approach is illustrated.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to utilize a limited length of wind records in providing extreme wind speeds for structural design, a stochastic model for generating long‐term annual extreme winds in a well‐behaved climate, on the basis of short period records, is developed and presented herein. Basically, this method uses historical wind data to establish Markov transition probabilities at an intended project site. These probabilities will be the guide for producing synthesized hourly wind speeds of a desired period, i.e., 100 annual extreme wind speeds would be obtained if hourly wind data for 100 yr were generated. Furthermore, if correlation is observed between the historical annual extreme winds and annual fastest mile wind speeds at a given site, then long‐term annual fastest mile wind speeds can be obtained. Applications of this model are demonstrated. The simulated 25‐yr, 50‐yr and 100‐yr wind speeds compared very favorably with those obtained by fitting Type I distribution of the largest values to the 33 historical annual fastest mile wind speeds for the Honolulu International Airport. However, the results from the proposed simulation model are less favorable for generating extreme winds for typhoon‐prone regions on the basis of short period historical data.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a study of energy requirements of membrane distillation (MD) for different lab-made flat module designs of 40 cm2 membrane area. The MD runs were carried out in direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) and vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) mode with a 0.2 Î¼m polypropylene membrane and in all tests pure water was fed to the system. In DCMD, the effect of the operating temperatures and streams flow rates on the flux, the evaporation efficiency and the energy consumption, was studied, whereas in VMD the parameters analyzed were the feed flow rate, the feed temperature and the vacuum applied at the permeate side.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present a Brownian dynamics simulation study where we employ the algorithm of Ermak and McCammon including solvent flow in the calculation of the rheological properties of Hookean dumbbells in steady shear flow. We have also included the possibility of the excluded volume and we have studied several possibilities with and without hydrodynamic interactions (HI). When hydrodynamic interaction is rigorously treated, the intrinsic viscosity is found to increase. If the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa HI tensor is used instead of the Oseen tensor, the changes in the material functions are quite small. On the other hand, excluded-volume interactions produce, as expected, an increase in the viscosity. This is so both with and without HI. Our results are compared with those of other works in which the HI tensor is pre-averaged or consistently averaged.},

  Abstract                 = {THERMO-OSMOSIS may be defined as the passage of a fluid through a membrane against the hydrostatic pressure, due to a temperature gradient. It was first observed by Lippmann1 in the passage of water through membranes of gelatine, etc. The fact that temperature gradients are able to give rise to a flow of matter is shown also by such varied phenomena as the thermal effusion of a gas through a porous diaphragm, the fountain effect in helium II, and also (in multicomponent systems) by thermal diffusion and the Soret effect.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the results of the experimental and numerical investigation of interactions between surface flood flow in urban areas and the flow in below ground drainage systems (sewer pipes and manholes). An experimental rig has been set up at the Water Engineering Laboratory at the University of Sheffield. It consists of a full scale gully structure with inlet grating, which connects the 8 m2 surface area with the pipe underneath that can function as an outfall and is also further connected to a tank so that it can come under surcharging conditions and cause outflow from the gully. A three-dimensional CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) model has been set up to investigate the hydraulic performance of this type of gully inlet during the interactions between surface flood flow and surcharged pipe flow. Preliminary results show that the numerical model can replicate various complex 3D flow features observed in laboratory conditions. This agreement is overall better in the case of water entering the gully than for the outflow conditions. The influence of the surface transverse slope on flow characteristics has been demonstrated. It is shown that re-circulation zones can form downstream from the gully. The number and size of these zones is influenced by the transverse terrain slope.},

  Abstract                 = {In Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games column in the February 1960 issue of Scientific American, there appeared a simple problem that has come to be known today as the Secretary Problem, or the Marriage Problem. It has since been taken up and developed by many eminent probabilists and statisticians and has been extended and generalized in many different directions so that now one can say that it constitutes a "field" within mathematics-probability-optimization. The object of this article is partly historical (to give a fresh view of the origins of the problem, touching upon Cayley and Kepler), partly review of the field (listing the subfields of recent interest), partly serious (to answer the question posed in the title), and partly entertainment. The contents of this paper were first given as the Allen T. Craig lecture at the University of Iowa, 1988.},

  Abstract                 = {The interpretation of experimental data on transport in porous materials is often based on the use of a single representative pore size, overlooking effects of the pore size distribution (PSD) and pore network connectivity, and fitting a tortuosity into which all such uncertainties are consigned. Using literature data on the diffusion of N2, Xe and i-C4H10 in mesoporous Shell silica spheres, we demonstrate that the tortuosity depends on the choice of the representative pore radius as well as gas species. Both the Knudsen model and the Oscillator model considering dispersive fluidâsolid interactions, developed in this laboratory, are found to adequately interpret the data in conjunction with effective medium theory (EMT) by fitting a network coordination number instead of tortuosity. This insensitivity to model is due to the large mean mesopore radius of 7.4nm for this silica; however, the Oscillator model is found to yield a value of the coordination number closer to the range of values expected for this material. Using the EMT we demonstrate that the tortuosity is dependent on temperature and diffusing species, because of differences in temperature dependence between the conductance at the representative pore radius and the true conductance which depends on the network connectivity and PSD. In the slip flow regime, which is obtained at large pore size, we show that the superposition of Knudsen and viscous mechanisms leads to temperature and species dependence of tortuosity, because of the different pore size dependence of the two contributions. This leads to different limiting tortuosities and PSD dependence in the Knudsen and viscous flow regimes. These critical aspects are largely unappreciated in the literature, and even systematic variations of tortuosity with temperature or diffusing species usually overlooked, often leading to misrepresentation of the underlying mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {The Thirteen Towers of Chankillo run north to south along a low ridge within a fourth-century B.C.E. ceremonial complex in north coastal Peru. From evident observing points within the adjacent buildings to the west and east, they formed an artificial toothed horizon that spanned--almost exactly--the annual rising and setting arcs of the Sun. The Chankillo towers thus provide evidence of early solar horizon observations and of the existence of sophisticated Sun cults, preceding the Sun pillars of Incaic Cusco by almost two millennia.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACTIn the present study two benchmark problems for turbulent dispersed particle-laden flow are investigated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). How the CFD programs OpenFOAM and ANSYS FLUENT model these flows is tested and compared. The numerical results obtained with LagrangianâEulerian (LE) point-particle (PP) models for Reynolds-averaged NavierâStokes (RANS) simulations of the fluid flow in steady state and transient modes are compared with the experimental data available in the literature. The effect of the dispersion model on the particle motion is investigated in particular, as well as the order of coupling between the continuous carrier phase and the dispersed phase. First, a backward-facing step (BFS) case is validated. As a second case, the confined bluff body (CBB) is used. The simulated fluid flows correspond well with the experimental data for both test cases. The results for the dispersed solid phase reveal a good accordance between the simulation results and the experiments. It seems that particle dispersion is slightly under-predicted when ANSYS FLUENT is used, whereas the applied solver in OpenFOAM overestimates the dispersion somewhat. Only minor differences between the coupling schemes are detected due to the low volume fractions and mass loadings that are investigated. In the BFS test case the importance of the spatial dimension of the numerical model is demonstrated. Even if it is reasonable to assume a two-dimensional fluid flow structure, it is crucial to simulate the turbulent particle-laden flow with a three-dimensional model since the turbulent dispersion of the particles is three-dimensional. },

  Abstract                 = {Trying to understand where major earthquakes and tsunamis might occur requires analysis of the sediments pouring into a subduction zone. Thick sediments were expected to limit earthquake and tsunami size in the Sumatran megathrust event in 2004, but the magnitude 9.2 earthquake defied expectations. H{\"u}pers et al. analyzed sediments recovered from the Sumatran megathrust. They found evidence of sediment dehydration, which increased fault strength and allowed for the much larger earthquake to occur. Thus, models of other subduction zones, such as the Gulf of Alaska, may underestimate the maximum earthquake magnitude and tsunami risk.Science, this issue p. 841Plate-boundary fault rupture during the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman subduction earthquake extended closer to the trench than expected, increasing earthquake and tsunami size. International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 362 sampled incoming sediments offshore northern Sumatra, revealing recent release of fresh water within the deep sediments. Thermal modeling links this freshening to amorphous silica dehydration driven by rapid burial-induced temperature increases in the past 9 million years. Complete dehydration of silicates is expected before plate subduction, contrasting with prevailing models for subduction seismogenesis calling for fluid production during subduction. Shallow slip offshore Sumatra appears driven by diagenetic strengthening of deeply buried fault-forming sediments, contrasting with weakening proposed for the shallow Tohoku-Oki 2011 rupture, but our results are applicable to other thickly sedimented subduction zones including those with limited earthquake records.},

  Abstract                 = {Algorithms developed to enable the use of atomistic molecular simulation methods with parallel computers are reviewed. Methods appropriate for bonded as well as non-bonded (and charged) interactions are included. While strategies for obtaining parallel molecular simulations have been developed for the full variety of atomistic simulation methods, molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo have received the most attention. Three main types of parallel molecular dynamics simulations have been developed, the replicated data decomposition, the spatial decomposition, and the force decomposition. For Monte Carlo simulations, parallel algorithms have been developed which can be divided into two categories, those which require a modified Markov chain and those which do not. Parallel algorithms developed for other simulation methods such as Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo, grand canonical molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo methods for protein structure determination are also reviewed and issues such as how to measure parallel efficiency, especially in the case of parallel Monte Carlo algorithms with modified Markov chains are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more ârepresentations,â in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular dynamics programs simulate the behavior of biomolecular systems, leading to understanding of their functions. However, the computational complexity of such simulations is enormous. Parallel machines provide the potential to meet this computational challenge. To harness this potential, it is necessary to develop a scalable program. It is also necessary that the program be easily modified by applicationâdomain programmers. The NAMD2 program presented in this paper seeks to provide these desirable features. It uses spatial decomposition combined with force decomposition to enhance scalability. It uses intelligent periodic load balancing, so as to maximally utilize the available compute power. It is modularly organized, and implemented using Charm++, a parallel C++ dialect, so as to enhance its modifiability. It uses a combination of numerical techniques and algorithms to ensure that energy drifts are minimized, ensuring accuracy in long running calculations. NAMD2 uses a portable run-time framework called Converse that also supports interoperability among multiple parallel paradigms. As a result, different components of applications can be written in the most appropriate parallel paradigms. NAMD2 runs on most parallel machines including workstation clusters and has yielded speedups in excess of 180 on 220 processors. This paper also describes the performance obtained on some benchmark applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Structural parameter is a representative quantity of a porous medium, often used to explain mass transfer rate in membrane processes. Intrinsic structural parameter is defined using characteristic constants of a porous medium, and effective structural parameter is indirectly obtained by analyzing measured fluxes, especially in osmosis-driven processes. Although the two parameters are fundamentally equivalent, recent experimental studies show noticeable discrepancies between them. To resolve the inconsistency, we hypothesize that the fraction of effective membrane surface area should include interfacial porosity between the active layer and the porous substrate. To test our hypothesis, we develop a new pore-scale \{CFD\} (computational fluid dynamics) solver for both mass and momentum transfer in transient forward osmosis phenomena. Two pre-existing solvers of OpenFOAM, an open-source computational fluid dynamics software package, are combined to seamlessly link the coupled transport phenomena across the active layer, the support layer, and the crossflow zone. We defined a new structural parameter using the simulated flux and the interfacial porosity, first addressed in this study, and obtained an excellent agreement between our \{CFD\} results and published experimental data in the literature. },

  Abstract                 = {Scientific computation is a discipline that combines numerical analysis, physical understanding, algorithm development, and structured programming. Several yottacycles per year on the world's largest computers are spent simulating problems as diverse as weather prediction, the properties of material composites, the behavior of biomolecules in solution, and the quantum nature of chemical compounds. This article is intended to review specfic languages features and their use in computational science. We will review the strengths and weaknesses of different programming styles, with examples taken from widely used scientific codes.},

The width of applicability of the model is demonstrated by reference to numerical computations of nine substantially different kinds of turbulent flow.},

This paper examines the effects of compaction on the gas permeability of microporous membranes to be used in MD. Contrary to what is observed in RO and UF systems where membrane permeability is reduced by compaction, limited compaction of microporous membranes can result in enhanced permeability. This enhancement is the result of decreased membrane thickness, which increases the pressure gradient across the membrane. An experimental method is devised to determine the effects of membrane compaction on permeability, and a theory for modifying flux equations to include a parameter for membrane compaction is introduced.},

  Abstract                 = {Pure water direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) experiments were used to measure the permeability parameter associated with the molecular diffusion in membrane distillation (MD). The fluxes given by a recently reported MD model, which is based on the dusty-gas model of gas transport through porous media, showed good agreement with the experimental results over the entire range of feed temperatures studied. The model was also capable of predicting flux as a function of the difference between bulk feed and permeate temperatures for the limiting case in which only molecular diffusion contributes to flow. The DCMD experiments were performed in this work with a new laboratory-scale module that does not require a support for flat-sheet membranes. The resulting DCMD fluxes were two to three times higher than those reported in the literature for either DCMD or reverse osmosis. The MD model was also used to predict the performance of DCMD desalination, and the results were compared to those of reverse osmosis, in terms of both water production rates and NaCl rejection.},

  Abstract                 = {In vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) process for desalination, water vapor flux is strongly affected by the hot brine heat transfer coefficient and membrane mass transfer coefficient. The VMD process has been studied here using porous hydrophobic polypropylene hollow fibers having three different dimensions, two different wall thicknesses and pore sizes. The outside surface of the hollow fibers has been coated with a variety of porous/microporous plasmapolymerized silicone fluoropolymer coatings. A large number of rectangular modules having the hot brine in cross flow over the outside of the fibers and vacuum on the fiber bore side have been investigated for their VMD performances to hot brine (1% NaCl) over a brine temperature range of 60â90 Â°C. Studies were carried out with hot water as well; further hot water flow in the tube side and vacuum in the shell side were also implemented. The shell-side Reynolds number was varied between 9 and 95. Module MXFR #3 containing larger size fibers having a much more open coating and larger pore size yielded at a high Reynolds number a water vapor flux as high as 71 kg/m2 h from a 85 Â°C hot feed in cross flow. The temperature polarization was reduced considerably with the temperature polarization coefficient varying between 0.93 and 0.99. Zukauskas equation for heat transfer coefficient in cross flow over a tube bank allows one to predict the water vapor flux behavior over a wide range of Reynolds number of the shell-side brine provided an empirically determined membrane mass transfer coefficient is employed.},

  Abstract                 = {Three polypropylene (PP) and one polyethylene (PE) microporous hollow-fiber membranes were used in direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) and vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) for the desalination of simulated seawater. The influence of feed temperature and feed flow on distillate pure water flux was investigated. The comparison of the PP and PE membranes in DCMD and VMD was carried out. It was found that the water flux increased with the feed temperature and feed flow in both DCMD and VMD. The data also showed that, compared with the PP membranes, higher water flux could be obtained by using PE membranes in both the DCMD and VMD processes.},

  Abstract                 = {This review summarizes theoretical progress in the field of active matter, placing it in the context of recent experiments. This approach offers a unified framework for the mechanical and statistical properties of living matter: biofilaments and molecular motors in vitro or in vivo, collections of motile microorganisms, animal flocks, and chemical or mechanical imitations. A major goal of this review is to integrate several approaches proposed in the literature, from semimicroscopic to phenomenological. In particular, first considered are “dry” systems, defined as those where momentum is not conserved due to friction with a substrate or an embedding porous medium. The differences and similarities between two types of orientationally ordered states, the nematic and the polar, are clarified. Next, the active hydrodynamics of suspensions or “wet” systems is discussed and the relation with and difference from the dry case, as well as various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter, are highlighted. Further highlighted are various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter. Various semimicroscopic derivations of the continuum theory are discussed and connected, highlighting the unifying and generic nature of the continuum model. Throughout the review, the experimental relevance of these theories for describing bacterial swarms and suspensions, the cytoskeleton of living cells, and vibrated granular material is discussed. Promising extensions toward greater realism in specific contexts from cell biology to animal behavior are suggested, and remarks are given on some exotic active-matter analogs. Last, the outlook for a quantitative understanding of active matter, through the interplay of detailed theory with controlled experiments on simplified systems, with living or artificial constituents, is summarized.},

  Abstract                 = {In the membrane distillation (MD) literature, the heat transfer coefficients of the boundary layers are usually estimated from well known heat transfer empirical correlations developed for non-porous and rigid heat exchangers. A difference between the mechanism of heat transfer in MD systems, which is coupled with transmembrane mass transfer, and the mechanism of heat transfer in âpureâ heat exchangers is expected to exist. Vacuum membrane distillation has been experimentally studied in a capillary membrane module and the heat transfer coefficients have been evaluated in both the lumen and the shell side of the membrane module. A critical review of the most frequently used heat transfer empirical correlations in MD systems is presented. Finally, the experimental results obtained in this paper are compared to those of literature, in order to test their applicability in membrane distillation systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to rapidly increasing resistance development against conventional antibiotics, finding novel approaches for the treatment of infections has emerged as a key health issue. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have attracted interest in this context, and there is by now a considerable literature on the identification such peptides, as well as on their optimization to reach potent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects at simultaneously low toxicity against human cells. In comparison, delivery systems for antimicrobial peptides have attracted considerably less interest. However, such delivery systems are likely to play a key role in the development of potent and safe AMP-based therapeutics, e.g., through reducing chemical or biological degradation of AMPs either in the formulation or after administration, by reducing adverse side-effects, by controlling AMP release rate, by promoting biofilm penetration, or through achieving co-localization with intracellular pathogens. Here, an overview is provided of the current understanding of delivery systems for antimicrobial peptides, with special focus on AMP-carrier interactions, as well as consequences of these interactions for antimicrobial and related biological effects of AMP-containing formulations.},

This broad range of free-volume element sizes compromises a polymer{\textquoteright}s ability to perform molecular separations. We demonstrated free-volume structures in dense vitreous polymers that enable outstanding molecular and ionic transport and separation performance that surpasses the limits of conventional polymers. The unusual microstructure in these materials can be systematically tailored by thermally driven segment rearrangement. Free-volume topologies can be tailored by controlling the degree of rearrangement, flexibility of the original chain, and judicious inclusion of small templating molecules. This rational tailoring of free-volume element architecture provides a route for preparing high-performance polymers for molecular-scale separations.},

  Abstract                 = {Membrane crystallization is an innovative concept to treat water and recover minerals from concentrates. Thus, it will also be beneficial to the existing mineral extraction industry. This process combines membrane distillation (MD) with crystallization. While MD produces water and concentrates the feed, crystalliser forms crystals from supersaturated minerals in the concentrated feed. This review covers principles of this process, factors affecting membrane crystallization for water treatment, application of membrane crystallization, resource recovery and the fouling of membrane crystallization. Membrane crystallization could recover many minerals including sodium, magnesium, barium, strontium, and lithium. However, fouling is a major challenge for its widespread implementation. Further directions for future research and development of this process are also considered with a view to the sustainable operation of the process.},

  Abstract                 = {Global Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) resources are assessed for the first time with an ocean general circulation model (OGCM). Large-scale OTEC operations are represented with fluid sources and sinks of prescribed strength in global (4Â°Â ÃÂ 4Â°) MITgcm simulations. Preliminary steady-state (time-asymptotic) results show similarities, but also significant differences with earlier one-dimensional (1-D) studies. It is confirmed that global OTEC resources are likely limited by OTEC flow effects on the stability of the vertical oceanic thermal structure. Such a limit is several times greater in a full three-dimensional context, however, with an estimated maximum annual OTEC net power production of about 30Â TW. The significant OTEC flow rates corresponding to maximum net power output would result in a strong boost of the oceanic thermohaline circulation (THC). In contrast to simple 1-D analyses, the present simulations of large-scale OTEC operations also show a persistent cooling of the tropical oceanic mixed-layer. This would be balanced by a warming trend in the higher latitudes, which may practically limit OTEC deployment to smaller flow rates than at maximum net power output. An annual OTEC net power production of about 7Â TW, for example, could be achieved with little effect on the oceanic temperature field.},

  Abstract                 = {An assembly of stone slabs on an isolated butte in New Mexico collimates sunlight onto spiral petroglyphs carved on a cliff face. The light illuminates the spirals in a changing pattern throughout the year and marks the solstices and equinoxes with particular images. The assembly can also be used to observe lunar phenomena. It is unique in archeoastronomy in utilizing the changing height of the midday sun throughout the year rather than its rising and setting points. The construct appears to be the result of deliberate work of the Anasazi Indians, the builders of the great pueblos in the area.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent archaeological research on the south coast of Peru discovered a Late Paracas (ca. 400-100 BCE) mound and geoglyph complex in the middle Chincha Valley. This complex consists of linear geoglyphs, circular rock features, ceremonial mounds, and settlements spread over a 40-km2 area. A striking feature of this culturally modified landscape is that the geoglyph lines converge on mounds and habitation sites to form discrete clusters. Likewise, these clusters contain a number of paired line segments and at least two U-shaped structures that marked the setting sun of the June solstice in antiquity. Excavations in three mounds confirm that they were built in Late Paracas times. The Chincha complex therefore predates the better-known Nasca lines to the south by several centuries and provides insight into the development and use of geoglyphs and platform mounds in Paracas society. The data presented here indicate that Paracas peoples engineered a carefully structured, ritualized landscape to demarcate areas and times for key ritual and social activities.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) for desalination of water using hollow fiber membranes with a shell-side feed configuration was investigated. The effects of membrane permeability, water salinity, feed temperature and flow rate on the water permeation rate were evaluated, and the water vapor pressure buildup in the fiber lumen was analyzed. The pressure buildup of water vapor in the fiber lumen was shown to adversely affect the driving force for water vapor permeation through the membrane pores, and a mathematical model was developed to describe the mass transfer in VMD by incorporating the permeate pressure build up. The model predictions were validated with experimental data. The higher the membrane permeability, the more significant the permeate pressure build-up. This is especially important to consider in module design for practical applications. For VMD of saline water, the membrane played a dominant role in the overall mass transfer process, and the significance of the effect of liquid phase resistance on water permeation depended on the membrane permeability. An increase in operating temperature increased the water productivity in VMD, primarily due to increased driving force for permeation, whereas the permeability of the membrane was not significantly affected. A factorial design experiment was carried out to illustrate the effects of main factors involving membrane permeability and operating parameters (feed concentration, temperature and flow rate) on the VMD performance, and some interactions among the effects were shown to occur as well.},

  Abstract                 = {Water transport induced by heat flow across cellophane and cellulose acetate membranes has been extensively studied in recent years. In comparing the results obtained by the various authors, remarkable differences emerge among the apparent behaviour of otherwise similar membranes. Discrepancies are so large that in some cases the very existence of this transport phenomenon has been questioned.
In this paper, an effect is discussed which appears significantly to affect heat-and-mass-transfer-coupled phenomena. A temperature polarization concept is used as an analogy to concentration polarization in reverse osmosis. This appears to account for most of the discrepancies in the published data. However, there remain differences in the experimental results which cannot be explained solely on the basis of “temperature polarization”. Thus, it appears necessary to perform further experimental investigations on thermo-osmosis through these membranes under well controlled thermal conditions. In this regard, a standard procedure is suggested which should allow determination of true thermo-osmotic transport coefficients, by accounting for thermal polarization effects.
A physical interpretation of mass transfer across membranes induced by heat flow is also introduced. This will be further developed in subsequent papers.},
